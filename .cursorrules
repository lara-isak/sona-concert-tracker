# Cursor AI Rules for SONA Project

## Code Review Before Push
When the user asks "anything to optimize before i push changes to github" or similar, perform a comprehensive code review:

1. **Check for duplicate code** - Look for repeated logic, functions, or patterns
2. **Review constant organization** - Ensure constants are properly organized and not duplicated
3. **Performance optimizations** - Check for:
   - Unnecessary re-renders
   - Missing memoization opportunities
   - Inefficient loops or filters
   - Date calculations that could be memoized
4. **Code structure** - Look for:
   - Functions that could be extracted
   - Components that could be split
   - Better organization of imports
5. **Type safety** - Ensure proper TypeScript usage
6. **Best practices** - Follow React/Next.js best practices

## Optimization Checklist
- [ ] Remove duplicate code/logic
- [ ] Organize constants and imports
- [ ] Add memoization where beneficial
- [ ] Optimize date calculations
- [ ] Check for unused variables/imports
- [ ] Review component structure
- [ ] Verify type safety
- [ ] Check for performance bottlenecks
